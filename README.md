# cellsds

This is the source code an all accompanying files for CellsDS, the homebrew sequencer for the Nintendo DS.  This code was written nearly 10 years ago, and I hadn't thought about opening the source code until now.  Please pardon the lack of code documentation.

Please refer to the user documentation and developer documentation for more information:
